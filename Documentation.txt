Documentation:
Our algorithm is split into two clear stages. In the first stage, a tournament is run
to generate a nonbinary heap for the indices. This is expected to run in O(n) time.
For a more precise number of comparisons, it is important how much n differers from a power of 2.
Our current implementation gives byes to the last index during a round of the tournament with an odd
number of competitors.
Theoretical WC:
In the theoretical worst case, there are ceil(lg(n)) rounds of the tournament with ceil(n/(2^round#))
comparisons during a round.
